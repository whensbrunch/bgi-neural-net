## Project structure

The repo is broken down into the following components:

- **tumor_parser**: a C++ string parser to handle massive amounts of DNA sequencing data in the form of "AGCT" and delimiters

- a Parallel Neural Network implementation in C++ with openMP

- a voting algorithm using SVM, Random Forest,KNN and other methods for classification
