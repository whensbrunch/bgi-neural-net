==============================================

This project was done for the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (IPAM) and the Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI). The research was performed in Hong Kong out of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST).

The repo is broken down into the following components:

1) a c++ string parser to handle tremendous amount of DNA sequencing data in the form of "AGCT" and limiters

2) a Parallel Neural Network implementation in C++ with openMP

3) a voting algorithm using SVM, Random Forest,KNN and other methods for classification
