==============================================

This project was done for the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (IPAM) and the Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI).

This is the code used developed during the project for RIPS-UCLA 2014 BGI Company at HKUST.

There are several parts of it, it contains:

1) a c++ string parser to handle tremendous amount of DNA sequencing data in the form of "AGCT" and limiters

2) a Parallel Neural Network implementation in C++ with openMP

3) a voting algorithm using SVM, Random Forest,KNN and other methods for classification
